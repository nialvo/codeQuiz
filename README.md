# codeQuiz

This program presents a basic JavaScript multiple choice quiz.<br>
There are five questions with four possible answers, and a one minute timer which drops 15 seconds every time an incorrect answer is selected.<br>
The border of the timer changes color every time we pass a ten second increment, progressing from blue to red.<br>
At the end of the quiz, the player has the option to enter their initials for the scoreboard, which is then displayed.<br><br>
